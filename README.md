# lattice-llm

This repo is heavily inspired from NIST's AtomGPT and directly uses it in many places. It can be found here:

This repo is under construction. A comprehensive README will be writted when src/main.py and src/hyperparameter_search.py are working without error.
Jupyter notebook examples will be written afterwards.
